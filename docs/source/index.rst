Welcome to Dissect!
===================

Effortlessly extract and investigate **forensic artefacts** from any source with **Dissect**.
With Dissect, you can go from intake call to patient zero in a matter of hours,
even in infrastructures with thousands of systems.


Quick Demo
----------

In just a couple of seconds you can query a **forensic image** or even open a shell!

.. image:: /images/demo.gif


Usage Example
-------------

One of the most prominent tools that Dissect offers is called *target-query*.
With this simple command you can for example extract all user accounts from a disk image: 

.. code-block:: console

    $ target-query pc.img -f users
    
    <windows/user ... name='systemprofile' ...>
    <windows/user ... name='LocalService' ...>
    <windows/user ... name='NetworkService' ...>
    <windows/user ... name='Mr. Evil' ...>
    
To see what other useful artefacts you can query use ``-l``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ target-query pc.img -l

This will list all Dissect functions and artefacts that are available for this image.
To list **all** functions and artefacts, regardless of the image, just leave out the image argument!

Key features
------------

Dissect is a powerful artefact extractor and parser that saves you a lot of time.
With Dissect you can:

* Quickly **extract artefacts** from any source (for example IMG, EWF, Kape, DD, VDI, PVM)
* Access artefacts from almost any OS (for example Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix, ESXi)
* Access almost any filesystem (for example NTFS, EXT, XFS, QNX6)
* **Parse logs**, registry entries, cookies, history and more, directly from the source
* Export findings to text, JSON, CSV or stream to datastores like Splunk, Elastic, MySQL
* Feed, filter and script to process found data in any way you like
* **Investigate images** with powerful tools like target-shell, target-mount or using our friendly Python API

Using these features, you can for instance (among other things):

* Make a timeline of the event log from all your investigation data at once.
* Identify anomalies in artefacts such as services, tasks and run keys over a large amount of investigation data.
* Do **incident response** on ransomwared (encrypted) virtual machine disks.
* **Extract artefacts** from LVM, RAID and other disk setups, without any manual configuration.
* Perform complex **IOC checks** on thousands of hosts in a couple of hours.
* Collect forensic artefacts from all live virtual machines directly from the hypervisor with no down time.
* Export all artefacts easily to any data format you want, for example CSV, JSON or Avro, or stream directly to Splunk or Elastic.

-------------

Dissect can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dissect
