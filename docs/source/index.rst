Welcome to Dissect!
===================

Effortlessly extract and investigate **forensic artefacts** from any source with **Dissect**.
With Dissect, you can go from intake call to patient zero in a matter of hours,
even in infrastructures with thousands of systems.


Quick Demo
----------

In just a couple of seconds you can query a forensic image or even explore it
using :doc:`/tools/target-shell`!

.. image:: /images/demo.gif


Usage Example
-------------

One of the most prominent tools that Dissect offers is called :doc:`/tools/target-query`.
With this simple one-liner you can extract all user accounts from an image: 

.. code-block:: console

    $ target-query pc.img -f users
    
    <windows/user ... name='systemprofile' ...>
    <windows/user ... name='LocalService' ...>
    <windows/user ... name='NetworkService' ...>
    <windows/user ... name='Mr. Evil' ...>
    
To see what other useful artefacts you can query use ``-l``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ target-query pc.img -l

This will list all Dissect functions and artefacts that are available for this image.
To list **all** functions and artefacts, regardless of the image, just leave out the image argument!


Key features
------------

Dissect is a powerful artefact extractor and parser that saves you a lot of time.
With Dissect you can:

* Quickly **extract** artefacts from any source (like IMG, EWF, Kape, DD, VDI, PVM)
* Access artefacts from almost any **OS** (like Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix, ESXi)
* Access almost any **filesystem** (like NTFS, EXT, XFS, QNX6)
* **Parse** (binary) logs, registry entries, cookies, history and more, directly from the source
* **Export** findings to text, JSON, CSV or stream to datastores like Splunk, Elastic, MySQL
* **Feed, filter and script** to process found data in any way you like
* Investigate images with powerful tools like **target-shell**, **target-mount** or the **Python API**

Using these features, you can for instance (among other things):

* Make a **timeline** of the event log from all your investigation data at once.
* Identify **anomalies** in artefacts such as services, tasks and run keys over a large amount of investigation data.
* Do incident response on partially **ransomwared** (encrypted) virtual machine disks.
* Extract artefacts from **LVM, RAID** and other disk setups, without any manual configuration.
* Perform complex **IOC checks** on thousands of hosts in a couple of hours.
* Collect forensic artefacts from all **live** virtual machines directly from the hypervisor with no down time.
* Export all artefacts easily to any data format you want, for example CSV, JSON or Avro, or stream directly to Splunk or Elastic.


Easy to install
-------------

Dissect can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dissect

It is recommended that you use a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_.

.. note ::
    .. include:: /versions.rst
    
You can also try dissect directly from within your browser:

`try.dissect.tools <https://try.dissect.tools>`_
    

Setup with Docker
-----------------

If you simply want to get started with some of the examples without having to install anything, a basic Docker image
is available `here <https://github.com/orgs/fox-it/packages/container/package/dissect>`_ (`mirror <https://hub.docker.com/r/dissect/dissect>`_).
You can start using this image by executing the following command in your terminal:
 
.. code-block:: console

    $ docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/targets/:/mnt:ro ghcr.io/fox-it/dissect:3.11
    (<dissect version>) <container hash>:/workspace$
