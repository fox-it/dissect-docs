Targets
=======

Targets (or target) is the terminology we use for the type of source data supported by ``dissect.target``. It includes
anything that can, one way or another, be used to describe a certain state of a system.

Some examples include:

* Raw disk images, virtual disks (``.vmdk``, ``.vhdx``, etc) and evidence containers (``.E01``)
* Virtual machine descriptor files (``.vmx``, ``.vmcx``, etc)
* Local live systems (``\\.\PhysicalDrive0``, ``/dev/sda``)
* Forensic packages such as ``.tar`` archives created by :doc:`/tools/acquire` or KAPE output directories
* ... and more

It's important to be aware of the difference between virtual machine descriptor (like ``.vmx``) and virtual disk
(like ``.vmdk``) files. For example, when using a ``.vmdk`` with Dissect, only that VMDK will be loaded, but when
using a ``.vmx``, all the ``.vmdk`` files described in that VMX file will be loaded instead. This ensures that systems
with multiple virtual disks work as intended. A ``.vmx`` file and ``.vmdk`` file are thus both valid targets. Keep this
in mind when working with investigative data.

On the technical side, everything eventually gets loaded into a ``Target`` Python object. The following sections
will go into more detail on how this object works. This is generally only useful information if you're looking to
interact with a target from your own Python code or writing a plugin for ``dissect.target``.

The ``Target`` object
---------------------

The :class:`~dissect.target.target.Target` class is your primary interaction point in ``dissect.target``. It represents
some system in some specific state, loaded from some target files. Any interaction you want to do with that system is
done through the ``Target`` class.

Conceptually a target consists of one or more :doc:`disks </advanced/containers>`, :doc:`volumes </advanced/volumes>`
and :doc:`filesystems </advanced/filesystems>`, which can be modified or added by :doc:`/advanced/loaders`.
These items are available as attributes on a ``Target`` instance we've named ``t`` at:

* ``t.disks``
* ``t.volumes``
* ``t.filesystems``

The next important attribute to know about is ``Target.fs``, which is the
:ref:`root filesystem <advanced/filesystems:root filesystem>`. This object behaves like any other filesystem in
``dissect.target``, but exists to allow other filesystems to be mounted at arbitrary paths or drive letters within
the context of a ``Target``. Use this when you need to interact with "the filesystem" of a target.

Finally, there are the :doc:`/advanced/plugins`. Plugins are functions that can be executed on a target. They can be as
simple as reading the hostname from ``/etc/hostname``, or as advanced as parsing a specific artefact like the
Windows event log.

Plugins are dynamically made available on the ``Target`` object. For example, if you wanted to run the ``evtx`` plugin
on a ``Target`` instance named ``t``, you would do ``t.evtx()``, which will:

* Check if the ``evtx`` function is already cached, otherwise perform a lookup which will:

  * Find a plugin that exports the ``evtx`` function and see if it's compatible.
  * Cache it and register it on the ``Target`` instance ``t``, it is now available as ``t.evtx``.

* If the plugin function is marked as a ``property``, it will behave like a Python ``@property``.
* If it's a function, calling it (``t.evtx()``) will execute the plugin function.

    For more information on how plugins work, please read their documentation at :doc:`/advanced/plugins`.

    To learn more about the ``Target`` object, it's recommended to read either the :class:`~dissect.target.target.Target`
    class documentation or the `source code <https://github.com/fox-it/dissect.target/blob/main/dissect/target/target.py>`_.

Initialisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Target`` initialisation usually starts with finding a :doc:`loader </advanced/loaders>` for a target, unless you're
:ref:`manually opening a target <advanced/targets:manually opening a target>`. If no compatible loader is found, the
default behaviour is to treat the target path as a container and add it as a disk.
After all of the discovered disks, volumes and/or filesystems are added by a loader (or the default behaviour), the
``Target`` object will continue initialisation.

Initialisation roughly consists of the following steps:

* Iterate ``Target.disks``.

  * Perform volume discovery using :func:`volume.open() <dissect.target.volume.open>` and add to ``Target.volumes``.
  * Add disk as a raw volume if no additional volumes were discovered.

* Iterate ``Target.volumes``.

  * Discover and open logical volume managers using :func:`volume.open_lvm() <dissect.target.volume.open_lvm>` and
    add discovered logical volumes to ``Target.volumes``.
  * Discover and open encrypted volumes using :func:`volume.open_encrypted() <dissect.target.volume.open_encrypted>` and
    add discovered and decrypted volumes to ``Target.volumes``.
  * Perform filesystem discovery using :func:`filesystem.open() dissect.target.filesystem.open>` and add discovered
    filesystems to ``Target.filesystems``.

* Basic initialisation is now done, OS detection still has to happen but that can fallback to a "no-op" OS plugin,
  leaving you able to interact with just the disks, volumes and filesystems.
* Find and iterate over all :ref:`advanced/plugins:os plugins` to find the most specific OS.

  * Subclasses of different OS plugins are considered "more specific", so e.g.
    :class:`~dissect.target.plugins.os.unix.debian._os.DebianPlugin` is more specific than
    :class:`~dissect.target.plugins.os.unix._os.LinuxPlugin`.

* OS initialisation is performed, this is can be super simple or extremely complex. Generally it consists of:

  * All the filesystems are mounted at their correct mount points in the
    :ref:`root filesystem <advanced/filesystems:root filesystem>`.
  * Optional additional OS specific parsing or initialisation is performed.

* The ``Target`` is now fully initialised.

Manually opening a target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple ways to open a ``Target`` object. The recommended way to open a single target is to use the
:func:`Target.open() <dissect.target.target.Target.open>` method, or
:func:`Target.open_all() <dissect.target.target.Target.open_all>` to open multiple targets from a single path. These
will return (or yield) a fully initialized and loaded ``Target`` object for you to start interacting with.

You can also opt to manually open a target. This can be useful when you're writing some code that needs to modify
attributes, or manually add things like filesystems. For example, a recovery script that scrapes for a filesystem
that may have had its superblock or ``$BOOT`` destroyed:

.. code-block:: python

    from dissect.target import Target

    t = Target()
    t.filesystems.add(recover_filesystem())
    t.apply()

    print(t.hostname)


Targets in targets
------------------

Dissect also supports the concept of targets within targets, referred to as child targets. For example, when a
target contains a ``.vmdk`` file within itself, we can tell ``dissect.target`` to load that target from within the
context of the first target. This can be useful when dealing with hypervisors.

Say, for example, we opened a Hyper-V target locally from ``\\.\PhysicalDrive0``, we can parse the metadata
in ``ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/Hyper-V/data.vmcx`` that tells us where all of the virtual machines are stored.
Then we can then use these paths and tell ``dissect.target`` to load another target from there. Reading all of these
files will still happen from ``\\.\PhysicalDrive0``, passing through the various abstraction layers of ``dissect.target``.
This allows Dissect to read the disks from running virtual machines, regardless of locks the operating has on these files.
